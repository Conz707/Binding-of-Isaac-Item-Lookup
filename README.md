# Binding of Isaac Item Lookup

Unfinished Project

Java application to lookup item information within the game "Binding of Isaac"

Due to not knowing what items did within the game and having to repeatedly look them up via google, I have created this application to do a shorthand way of looking up items. It takes the item name and pulls information from the wikia and displays it and the item image to allow the user to verify it is the correct item.

After finishing this I will be attempting to integrate the item lookup within the game to allow me to view information without having to tab from the game.
